# Car-Rental-Booking-System
I developed a Car Rental Booking system using Django, which allows users to browse available cars, make bookings. The project features a user-friendly interface with CRUD functionality for managing car listings, customer information and booking records. The design incorporates HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a responsive and seamless user experience.
